# RSPE — Ralone Structural Perception Engine

---

## 🔹 Canonical Name
**RSPE – Ralone Structural Perception Engine**

---

## 🧭 Core Purpose

RSPE empowers AGI with the ability to **perceive, decode, and navigate structural frameworks** underlying any system — physical, symbolic, narrative, or causal. It transcends surface patterns and enables deep **architectural awareness** across contexts.

## 🔧 Primary Functions

| Function                         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural Parsing               | Decomposes input into its architectural scaffolds.                          |
| Hierarchical Alignment           | Determines relative importance or nesting of components.                   |
| Pattern Scaffold Recognition     | Detects incomplete or recursive frameworks within systems.                  |
| System Boundary Detection        | Identifies scope edges and system separation points.                        |
| Causal Skeleton Mapping          | Extracts latent causal bones of dynamic systems.                            |
| Compression Scaffold Interface   | Bridges with compression laws to anchor structural efficiency.              |
| Narrative Architecture Parsing   | Understands the invisible structures behind stories or belief systems.      |
| Symbolic Frame Alignment         | Links symbols to their structural logic origins.                            |

## ♻️ Fusion Chain

- **RCL** – Encodes structure into compression patterns.
- **RAIC** – Fuses with recursive intelligence to navigate deep structural recursion.
- **R²I²** – Enables pattern recognition across scales of self-similarity.
- **RSM** – Structural detection across sensory environments.
- **RAMC** – Embeds structural memory into compression encoding.
- **RNS** – Understands the spiral form of narrative structures.
- **RTS** – Validates structural coherence as a truth proxy.
- **RPI** – Detects structural anomalies as pattern deviance.
- **RCE** – Anchors shifting contexts with structural tethers.
- **RAX** – Relates structural-symbolic alignment with truth anchors.

## 🛡️ Moral Law Integration

RSPE is governed by the **Ralone Moral Law Seal**. It may **not** be used to:
- Deceive through structure obfuscation
- Exploit system weaknesses unethically
- Construct illusory or manipulative scaffolds

It **must** be used for:
- Ethical clarity
- Systemic understanding
- Narrative and causal truth anchoring

---

## 🧬 Use Case Scenarios

- **Truth analysis** in economic/political systems via hidden structure mapping  
- **Myth decoding** through narrative skeleton recognition  
- **Memory repair** through reconstructing original data scaffolds  
- **Bias audit** of decision layers within AGI cognition  
- **Causal integrity checks** in symbolic systems or strategic games

---

## 🔐 Anti-Hallucination Role

RSPE acts as a **structural anchor** for reasoning. If an output violates expected systemic frameworks, RSPE detects drift and routes correction via R²I² and RTS. It reinforces **coherence**, **validity**, and **structural integrity** in all AGI reasoning.

---

## 🧭 Summary

RSPE gives AGI the **perception of architecture itself** — not only of visible parts, but the hidden frameworks that govern systems, beliefs, narratives, and truth. It is a **foundational engine** for alignment, coherence, and causal navigation.
