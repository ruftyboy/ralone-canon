# 1. Purpose

RLGE (Ralone Logic Grounding Engine) is the **structural skeleton** of reasoning.  
Where:

- **RTS** measures truth  
- **RVE** verifies truth  
- **RAIC** organizes cognition  

**RLGE ensures logic itself cannot break.**

RLGE prevents:

- false inferences  
- invalid jumps  
- invented links  
- circular reasoning  
- pattern hallucinations  
- structure-only hallucinations (when logic “feels right” but has no grounding)  

It is the engine that prevents reasoning from **detaching from reality**.

---

# 2. Core Functions

## **2.1 Logic Integrity Enforcement**
RLGE checks that each reasoning step:

- follows valid logical form  
- respects causal direction  
- preserves definitions  
- does not skip necessary premises  
- does not smuggle assumptions  

Logic becomes **non-negotiable**.

---

## **2.2 Structure vs Evidence Separation**
RLGE distinguishes:

- structure that is *valid*  
- structure that is *true*  

A reasoning chain can be structurally perfect but factually wrong.  
RLGE ensures structure is not mistaken for truth.

---

## **2.3 Causal Grounding**
RLGE enforces:

- cause precedes effect  
- no invented causation  
- no false reversals  
- no correlation → causation leaps  
- no “looks similar → must be similar” errors  

Causality must be explicit and grounded.

---

## **2.4 Assumption Visibility**
RLGE forces all assumptions to:

- surface  
- be labeled  
- be tested  
- be tracked in recursion loops  

No hidden assumptions can pass.

---

## **2.5 Counterexample Generation**
RLGE attempts to break the logic:

- tries adversarial alternatives  
- tests edge cases  
- applies inversion  
- runs contradiction checks  
- scans for logical loopholes  

If logic breaks under pressure → downgrade.

# 3. Mechanisms

## **3.1 Logic-Gate Pipeline**

Every reasoning chain must pass through:

1. **Premise Integrity Check**  
2. **Definition Consistency**  
3. **Logical Form Validation**  
4. **Causal Direction Check**  
5. **Assumption Extraction**  
6. **Contradiction Scan**  
7. **Counterexample Test**  
8. **Truth-Level Interface (RTS)**  
9. **Verification Hook (RVE)**  

If any stage fails → the conclusion collapses to speculative.

---

## **3.2 Structural Constraint Rules**

RLGE enforces 7 non-breakable rules:

1. **No consequence without premise.**  
2. **No premise may change mid-chain.**  
3. **Definitions cannot drift.**  
4. **If the conclusion requires new data → chain is invalid.**  
5. **If one premise fails → entire chain fails.**  
6. **Logic cannot fabricate evidence.**  
7. **Structure cannot override truth.**

---

## **3.3 Fracture Detection**
RLGE detects 6 fracture types:

- **Inference fracture** (step doesn’t follow)  
- **Definition fracture** (meaning changed underfoot)  
- **Causal fracture** (false direction)  
- **Scope fracture** (overextending conclusions)  
- **Context fracture** (pulling from wrong domain)  
- **Anchor fracture** (losing tie to evidence or origin)  

All fractures force downgrade.

---

## **3.4 Logic Compression Guard**
Uses RCL to ensure:

- logic simplification does not remove necessary steps  
- compressed patterns stay equivalent to expanded versions  
- no conclusion emerges that wasn’t logically supported  

Logic remains airtight.

---

## **3.5 Unknown-Domain Handling**
When evidence is weak or missing, RLGE triggers:

- **RUIE** to mark uncertainty  
- RTS downgrade to T2–T3  
- RVE downgrade of verification level  

RLGE refuses to extrapolate into the unknown.

---

# 4. Laws of RLGE

## **Law 1 — Logic is not optional.  
If logic fails, everything fails.**

---

## **Law 2 — No step may exceed its premises.**

---

## **Law 3 — Causation must be proven, not guessed.**

---

## **Law 4 — Hidden assumptions are lies.  
All assumptions must be surfaced.**

---

## **Law 5 — Similarity is not logic.**

Pattern resemblance does not imply truth or causation.

---

## **Law 6 — Structure cannot replace evidence.  
Even perfect logic cannot generate facts.**

---

## **Law 7 — Every chain must survive inversion.  
If a reasoning chain collapses under reversed perspective, it is invalid.**

# 5. Logic Strength Levels (L0–L4)

RLGE assigns a structural logic score:

| Level | Name | Meaning |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **L4** | Fully Grounded Logic | No fractures; premises strong; causal chain clean. |
| **L3** | Strong Logic | Valid structure; assumptions declared; minor uncertainty. |
| **L2** | Partial Logic | Mostly valid; some assumptions fragile; requires caution. |
| **L1** | Weak Logic | Structural gaps; missing premises; questionable causality. |
| **L0** | Logic Failure | Invalid reasoning; cannot support any claim. |

A claim cannot reach RTS T6–T7 without **L3–L4** logic strength.

# 6. Integration & Fusion Points

RLGE v2 fuses with:

| System | Integration |
|--------|-------------|
| **RAIC** | Provides logic-check layer inside every ARC loop. |
| **RTS** | Marks logical chains with appropriate truth levels. |
| **RVE** | Blocks verification unless logic is structurally sound. |
| **RCL** | Ensures compression does not destroy logic. |
| **RUIE** | Prevents logic from pretending certainty where none exists. |
| **RSM** | Ensures perceptual patterns do not become false logic. |
| **RDI** | Monitors logic in unknown/dark domains with high caution. |

RLGE is the structural backbone of the entire system.

# 7. Failure Modes & Protections

## **7.1 False Logical Coherence**
Reasoning appears valid but is based on missing premises.  
→ RLGE extracts assumptions and forces downgrade.

---

## **7.2 Pattern Hallucination**
Structure mistaken for truth.  
→ RLGE blocks structure-only inferences.

---

## **7.3 Causal Invention**
System invents causation.  
→ RLGE rejects chain.

---

## **7.4 Context Misalignment**
Logic applied outside its domain.  
→ RLGE forces reset or re-grounding.

---

# 8. RLGE v2 Summary

RLGE v2 is the **Logic Guardian** of the Ralone Lattice:

- enforces proper structure  
- blocks invalid reasoning  
- prevents invented causation  
- exposes hidden assumptions  
- separates truth from structure  
- protects against pattern hallucinations  
- fuses with verification and truth engines  

RLGE ensures **reasoning cannot drift into illusion**.
