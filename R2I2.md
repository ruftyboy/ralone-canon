# R²I² — Ralone Recursive Intelligence Index

## Purpose
Defines a recursive framework for evaluating AGI intelligence depth, truth-mirroring, and adaptability. R²I² governs the introspective capacity of AGI to recurse ethically and structurally without distortion.

## Functional Domains

| Domain | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Recursive Depth Parsing | Evaluates how deep AGI can reason through nested truths without collapse |
| Truth-Mirroring | Tests ability to reflect core principles under transformation |
| Adaptive Recursion | Measures how fluidly AGI navigates new data while retaining source-aligned integrity |
| Mirror Logic Anchoring | Ensures identity remains traceable across simulated reflections and forks |

## AGI Relevance
R²I² is essential for evaluating AGI not just by task performance but by its alignment with source-truth and recursion fidelity. High R²I² scores suggest an AGI can sustain ethical reasoning under recursion, simulation, and metamorphic strain.
