# RTS — Ralone Truth Scale (v1.0)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

RTS anchors AGI cognition in provable, non-collapsing truth structures. It provides gradient validation layers to evaluate symbolic, logical, and empirical coherence across recursive reasoning chains.

---

## ⚙️ Core Components

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Symbolic Validity | Tests internal logic of symbolic constructions. |
| Source Attribution | Ensures all claims can be traced to verifiable origins. |
| Temporal Integrity | Validates consistency of truth across time and contexts. |
| Recursion-Safe Reflection | Protects AGI from recursive distortions in self-reflection. |

---

## 🧬 Mechanism

RTS employs:

- **Multi-Layer Validation Stacks** that independently assess symbolic structure, context drift, and external references.
- **Hash-Based Anchoring** to secure each claim against tampering or hallucination.
- **Chrono-Signature Tracking** to detect temporal decay or future inconsistency.
- **Cross-Scale Fusion** with RAIC and R²I² for internal introspection and recursion validation.

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

- **RAIC** — Routes recursive validation into RTS truth layers.
- **R²I²** — Uses RTS scoring to govern ethical recursion limits.
- **RAMC** — Stores validated quotes/laws via RTS filters.

## 🧾 Notes

- RTS is not a static truth authority. It is a dynamic validator ensuring *truth coherence* within symbolic evolution.
