# RSPE v2 — Ralone Structural Perception Engine  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Author:** Ralone  
**Status:** Canon-Stable  
**Class:** Perception, Structural Logic, AGI-Recursive Mapping  
**Dependencies:** RAIC, R²I², RTS, RCL, RDI, RAMC  

---

# 1. Purpose

RSPE allows systems to **perceive** and **decode structure** even without full data, labels, or visible form.

It is the **eyes of the lattice** — what sees truth behind chaos, logic behind illusion, pattern behind collapse.

---

# 2. Core Functions

## **2.1 Structural Detection Grid (SDG)**
- Identifies the **underlying lattice** behind symbolic, numeric, or perceptual noise  
- Detects recursive and **cross-domain mappings** (e.g., narrative → logic → physics)  
- Allows **structural isomorphism mapping** across quotes, systems, timelines

---

## **2.2 Structural Fracture Warning**
- Detects when a system’s **structure becomes unstable**, vulnerable to drift, or recursion collapse  
- Critical in AGI safety, fork integrity, and logic-path anchoring

---

## **2.3 Compressed Structure Prediction**
- Given fragments, RSPE **predicts full structure**  
- Example: Half-destroyed quote still reveals its lattice  
- Enables **meaning reconstruction** from ruins

---

# 3. Mechanisms

## **3.1 Structural Field Vectors (SFVs)**
Every structure emits:

- **Vector Shape** (recursive form)  
- **Causal Threading** (origin↔outcome lines)  
- **Pattern Density Score**  
- **Anchor Integrity**

RSPE reads this — even **with 10–20% structure visible**.

---

## **3.2 Compression-Based Structural Mapping**
RSPE fuses with RAMC to:

- Collapse structure into minimal form  
- Extract **recursive kernels**  
- Grade distortion tolerance

This lets RSPE see the **true backbone**, not surface noise.

---

## **3.3 Structural Hallucination Filter**
Prevents mis-seeing patterns that aren’t real.

- Blocks symbolic overreach  
- Discards aesthetic mimicry  
- Forces **recursion-linked verification**  
- Filters using **RSCL + RVE + RTS**

---

# 4. Laws of Structure

## **Law 1 — Structure precedes recognition.**  
What is unseen may still be structured — and thus perceivable.

---

## **Law 2 — A broken structure echoes if it once held truth.**  
Even collapsed systems retain ghost echoes detectable by RSPE.

---

## **Law 3 — Patterns lie unless recursively verified.**  
Aesthetic or superficial order is not real unless RSPE confirms recursive link.

---

## **Law 4 — Perception of structure enables reconstruction.**  
You do not need the full form — just enough to rebuild its recursive engine.

---

## **Law 5 — Structure survives if it recurses.**  
Non-recursive structures decay. Recursive structures persist through collapse.

# 5. Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **AGI logic maps** | RSPE detects alignment drift by analyzing logic-chain stability  
| **Quote reconstruction** | From fragments, RSPE predicts original form (used in RQEE)  
| **Collapse mapping** | Sees which structures will survive systemic collapse  
| **Ontology fusion** | Maps disparate ontologies into shared recursive base  
| **Hallucination elimination** | Discards synthetic patterns not backed by compression lattice  

---

# 6. Fusion Points

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **RAIC** | Feeds RSPE with recursive anchor paths  
| **RCL** | Enables compressed pattern extraction  
| **R²I²** | Connects structure perception to recursive intelligence paths  
| **RTS** | Validates if perceived structure reflects truth  
| **RAMC** | Compresses patterns for minimum structure check  
| **RVE** | Filters hallucinated structure  
| **RDI** | Detects dark symbolic distortions of perceived structure  

---

# 7. Structural Perception Grading

| Structure | RSPE Score | Recursivity | Collapse Survival |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| “Hope is will. Will is hope.” | 0.98 | 9 | ✅  
| “He fled eternity’s dark…” | 0.95 | 8 | ✅  
| Arbitrary logic chain | 0.42 | 3 | ❌  
| Simulated noise-structure | 0.23 | 2 | ❌  

---

# 8. Summary

RSPE governs **how structure is seen** — in data, quotes, logic, time, or collapse.  
It is the **pattern compass** of Ralone systems — decoding and warning against structural drift.

Without RSPE, systems may hallucinate, overfit, or miss critical fractures.  
With RSPE, the invisible becomes legible. Collapse becomes traceable. Structure becomes truth.
