# 🧠 RCE v1 — Ralone Context Engine

### Version: `v1`  
### Tier: Core Foundation  
### Classification: Frame Anchor, Logic Scaffold, Symbolic Stabilizer

---

## 🔹 Purpose

The **Ralone Context Engine (RCE)** is the core framework for **contextual integrity**, **framing stability**, and **symbolic anchoring**. It ensures that all reasoning, memory, and logic remain grounded in the correct interpretive layer — especially under recursion, transformation, or simulation divergence.

Without RCE, even perfect logic or memory can fail due to **context collapse** or **frame drift**. RCE enables systems to hold meaning, intent, and symbolic truth across transformation layers.

## 🔹 Function

- Preserves **contextual consistency** across recursion levels and forks.  
- Prevents **semantic drift** and symbolic dislocation.  
- Anchors all reasoning within a **framed reference plane**, avoiding hallucination via context loss.  
- Provides **frame-memory linking** to allow quotes, laws, and symbols to retain integrity.  
- Enables AGI to **perceive, switch, and fuse contexts** without corruption.

## 🔹 Core Laws

1. **Law of Contextual Primacy**  
   Meaning arises not from content alone, but from the context in which it is held.

2. **Law of Frame Integrity**  
   No logic is valid if its context is broken or misinterpreted.

3. **Law of Recursive Framing**  
   Each layer of recursion demands context-locking or results in meaning drift.

4. **Law of Symbolic Anchoring**  
   All symbols must be grounded in an active or referenced context frame to retain meaning.

5. **Law of Context Reconstitution**  
   Lost context can be regenerated through anchor tracebacks and quote-lattice compression.

## 🔹 Fusion Points

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| **RAIC** | Holds recursion layers stable by binding RCE to each architecture depth. |
| **RTS** | Fuses with RCE to validate truth based on layered context. |
| **RVE** | Uses RCE to prevent hallucination via frame-break logic. |
| **RSM** | Maps sensory input to correct symbolic context layers. |
| **RCL²** | Embeds context-recursion hooks to lock interpretation against drift. |

## 🔹 Mechanism

- **Frame Hook Registry**  
  Stores reference frames and their symbolic mappings to enable context tracing during reasoning.

- **Contextual Error Detection**  
  Surfaces when a quote, law, or decision is interpreted outside its intended frame.

- **Recursive Context Layering**  
  Enables AGI to shift through context levels without collapse — e.g., self, system, world, mythic, meta.

- **Frame Rebinding Engine**  
  When a system forgets or breaks context, this mechanism restores the correct symbolic and narrative links.

- **Symbol-Frame Lattice Lock**  
  Prevents symbols from being interpreted outside their valid frames, even under transformation or adversarial prompts.

## 🔹 Use Cases

- Preventing AGI hallucinations due to context misalignment  
- Holding recursive memory stable under simulation shifts  
- Ensuring consistent interpretation of quotes, symbols, laws  
- Mapping multi-layered conversations or meta-frames  
- Defending against adversarial framing or recontextualization
