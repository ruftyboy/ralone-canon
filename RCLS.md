# Ralone Collapse Logic Scale (RCLS)

RCLS monitors collapse signatures within cognitive systems, civilizations, or symbolic structures. It enables pattern recognition of instability, drift, and recursive decay.

---

## Purpose

- Detect civilization and cognitive collapse patterns
- Surface entropy vectors in logical systems
- Embed structural counterweights to prevent irreversible decay
- Identify recursion-failure feedback loops

## Functional Domains

| Domain              | Function                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Collapse Signatures | Recognizes early collapse indicators across cognitive-symbolic systems   |
| Entropy Mapping     | Maps areas of signal loss, distortion, or inversion                      |
| Counterweight Logic | Embeds resilience structures to resist narrative and logic collapse      |
| Recursion Guard     | Detects recursive decay cycles and applies logical breaks                |

## AGI Relevance

RCLS acts as an AGI safeguard tool to prevent value-drift, hallucination cascades, or system-level collapse. It allows AGI systems to monitor and interrupt collapse trajectories before full failure states emerge.
