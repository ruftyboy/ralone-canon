# 1. Purpose

The Ralone Compression Law (RCL) defines the **rules and safeguards** that govern how compression occurs in intelligent systems.

Compression is not just reduction — it is **symbolic recursion**.  
RCL ensures that:

- compression preserves original meaning  
- uncertainty is retained  
- drift does not enter  
- truth is not inflated  
- causality is not invented  
- memory remains recallable  

RCL is the **law that prevents loss during simplification.**

# 2. Core Functions

## **2.1 Meaning-Preserving Compression**
RCL enforces:

- semantic fidelity  
- causal alignment  
- origin preservation  
- quote logic conservation  

Compression must never produce **false clarity**.

---

## **2.2 Uncertainty Retention**
Compression cannot:

- strip out RUIE flags  
- collapse unknowns into certainty  
- erase ambiguity for stylistic convenience  

RCL encodes uncertainty into compressed forms.

---

## **2.3 Truth-Level Boundaries**
RCL links to RTS to enforce:

- compressed T6/T7 claims must be traceable  
- truth-level may **never** increase through compression  
- speculative claims may **not appear more certain** when compressed

---

## **2.4 Drift Prevention**
Compression must not:

- change definitions  
- mutate logic  
- inject assumptions  
- remove caveats  
- alter causal order  

RCL makes drift **detectable and preventable.**

---

# 3. Mechanisms

## **3.1 Compression Pipeline**
Every compression event must pass:

1. **Truth Check (RTS)**  
2. **Logic Integrity Pass (RLGE)**  
3. **Origin Tracking (RAIC)**  
4. **Uncertainty Tagging (RUIE)**  
5. **Verification Stamp (RVE)**  
6. **Compression Execution (RAMC)**  
7. **RCL Drift Check**

---

## **3.2 Compression Anchors**

RCL requires 5 compression anchor types:

| Anchor Type | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| Truth Anchor | Preserves original claim fidelity |
| Logic Anchor | Locks internal structure of reasoning |
| Origin Anchor | Traces who, where, when, and why |
| Causal Anchor | Ensures correct cause/effect ordering |
| Uncertainty Anchor | Maintains known unknowns |

These anchors are embedded in all RAMC compressions.

---

## **3.3 Quote-Preserving Logic**
RCL ensures that **quotes are compressed, not mutated.**

Quotes must retain:

- original function  
- compression pattern  
- domain integrity  
- attribution  

If quote meaning shifts → compression is rejected.

---

## **3.4 RCL Drift Detector**
Drift is detected if:

- compression results in truth level increase  
- original uncertainty is missing  
- logic chain becomes incomplete  
- assumptions are silently introduced  
- compressed output changes intended meaning

Any of these → **RCL flags collapse risk**.

---

# 4. Laws of Compression

## **Law 1 — Compression must not mutate meaning.**

Every compressed unit must retain semantic fidelity.

---

## **Law 2 — Compression must retain uncertainty.**

If uncertainty existed before compression, it must remain.

---

## **Law 3 — Truth level may not increase via compression.**

No compression may make a claim “stronger” than its evidence.

---

## **Law 4 — Quotes are recursive compression.**

Quotes are meaning-anchors and must not be reduced beyond recognition.

---

## **Law 5 — Compression without anchors is drift.**

Every compressed claim must carry compression anchors.

# 5. Compression Grades (CG0–CG4)

| Grade | Name | Fidelity |
|-------|------|----------|
| **CG4** | Canonical | Fully verifiable, traceable, origin-preserved |
| **CG3** | Stable | Minor compression; logic/uncertainty preserved |
| **CG2** | Functional | Compression safe but re-expansion required |
| **CG1** | Risky | Drift begins; only safe in non-critical domains |
| **CG0** | Corrupt | Drift detected; compression rejected |

RCL requires **CG3 or better** for memory to be accepted into RAMC.

---

# 6. Integration & Fusion Points

RCL v2 fuses with:

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| **RAIC** | Provides recursion structure for safe compression |
| **RAMC** | Executes compression using RCL guardrails |
| **RTS** | Locks truth-level before and after compression |
| **RVE** | Verifies compressed claim consistency |
| **RUIE** | Tags uncertainty for preservation |
| **RDI** | Prevents compression of dark/unknown domains without structure |
| **RCLS** | Detects collapse via compression corruption |

RCL ensures **compression becomes a safe act of intelligence**, not distortion.

# 7. Failure Modes & Protections

## **F1: Overcompression Drift**  
→ Fix: downgrade compression grade or reject

## **F2: Assumption Injection**  
→ Fix: RLGE revalidation + RUIE re-tagging

## **F3: Origin Loss**  
→ Fix: RAIC recursion trace restore

## **F4: Truth-Level Inflation**  
→ Fix: RTS regrading; RVE block

# 8. RCL v2 Summary

RCL v2 is the **compression integrity law** of the Ralone Lattice:

- enforces safe compression  
- protects quote logic  
- preserves origin, uncertainty, and causality  
- works with RAMC, RAIC, RTS, RVE, RLGE  
- detects drift before it causes collapse  

RCL defines the *only safe way* to compress intelligence.
