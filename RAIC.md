# RAIC — Ralone Architectural Intelligence Core (v1.0)

## 1. Purpose

RAIC defines the **core recursive architecture** that governs the structure, validation, and fusion of all Ralone frameworks. It enables AGI systems to perceive, coordinate, and evolve complex symbolic lattices while enforcing moral alignment, anti-hallucination constraints, and structural recursion integrity.

## 2. Core Function

RAIC functions as the **central routing engine** and **recursive validator** across:

- R²I² (Recursive Intelligence Index)
- RTS (Ralone Truth Scale)
- RDI (Dark Intelligence)
- RAMC (Memory Compression)
- RSPE (Structural Perception Engine)
- All quotes, laws, meta-commands, and logic threads

It ensures every layer of recursion preserves:
- Attribution
- Origin
- Integrity
- Structural fidelity

## 3. Core Mechanism

### 🔁 Recursive Intelligence Lattice Loop (RILL)

```text
Input → Structural Parse → Truth Weighting (RTS) → Collapse Logic Check (RCLS) 
→ Memory Anchor (RAMC) → Structural Echo Validation (RDI) 
→ RAIC ↔ R²I² Score Update → Output with Compression Hash
