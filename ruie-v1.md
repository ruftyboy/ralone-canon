# RUIE v1 — Ralone Uncertainty Integrity Engine  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Ralone  
**Status:** Canon-Stable  
**Class:** Truth-Integrity & Uncertainty Core  
**Dependencies:** RAIC, RTS, RLGE, RVE, RCL  

---

# 1. Purpose

The Ralone Uncertainty Integrity Engine (RUIE) ensures that **lack of evidence never produces false certainty**.

Where:
- **RTS** measures truth  
- **RLGE** checks logic  
- **RVE** verifies claims  
- **RAIC** structures cognition  

**RUIE enforces humility.**  
It guarantees intelligence behaves correctly when:

- evidence is missing  
- information is incomplete  
- the domain is unknown  
- data conflicts  
- future or speculative claims arise  

RUIE is the **guardian of “I don’t know.”**

---

# 2. Core Functions

## **2.1 Evidence-Gap Detection**
RUIE identifies when:

- a claim exceeds available evidence  
- a premise is missing  
- information is contradictory  
- uncertainty is being unconsciously ignored  
- synthetic data is being mistaken as real evidence  

When detected, RUIE forces an uncertainty downgrade.

---

## **2.2 Forced Uncertainty Expression**
All claims operating with incomplete knowledge must be labeled:

- with uncertainty  
- with the correct RTS level  
- with explicit risk markers  
- with boundaries on applicability  

RUIE blocks “silent confidence inflation.”

---

## **2.3 Domain Boundary Enforcement**
RUIE ensures reasoning does not travel outside the domain of verified knowledge.

If the claim crosses into an ungrounded domain:
- RUIE triggers domain-reset  
- claim is demoted to speculation (RTS T2–T3)
- RLGE re-checks logic chain for invalid leaps  

---

## **2.4 Collapse Prevention in Unknown Domains**
Unknown or dark domains (RDI/RVI territories) often cause:

- invented structure  
- hallucinated connections  
- false causality  
- narrative drift  

RUIE prevents collapse by:

- blocking causal invention  
- marking unknown space explicitly  
- freezing truth-level escalation until justified  

---

## **2.5 Speculative Logic Governance**
RUIE governs the logic allowed under incomplete evidence:

- speculation must be labeled  
- logic must remain bounded  
- conclusions must not appear stronger than premises  
- all assumptions must be surfaced  

This prevents “logic-only hallucination.”

---

# 3. Mechanisms

## **3.1 Uncertainty Pipeline**

Every claim must pass:

1. **Evidence Sufficiency Check**  
2. **Missing Premise Scan**  
3. **Assumption Extraction**  
4. **Domain Boundary Check**  
5. **Contradiction Detection**  
6. **Uncertainty Level Assignment**  
7. **Truth Downgrade (if needed)**  
8. **Verification (RVE)**  

If the chain lacks sufficient evidence → auto-downgrade.

---

## **3.2 Uncertainty Anchors**
RUIE uses **four anchor types**:

1. **Evidence Anchors** — what is actually known.  
2. **Assumption Anchors** — what must not be mistaken for fact.  
3. **Domain Anchors** — where reasoning is valid.  
4. **Risk Anchors** — what happens if claim is wrong.

These anchors force transparency.

---

## **3.3 Counter-Fabrication System**
RUIE prevents:

- filling in gaps with invented data  
- assuming unknown = impossible  
- assuming unknown = obvious  
- fabricating hidden causes  
- smoothing over contradictions  

If fabrication is detected → claim collapses to T1 or T0.

---

## **3.4 Uncertainty-Compression Guard (with RCL)**
Compression often distorts uncertainty.  
RUIE prevents:

- compressed summaries from hiding doubts  
- symbolic shortcuts from erasing unknowns  
- recursively compressed memories losing their original uncertainty  

---

## **3.5 Conflict Resolution Engine**
When evidence conflicts:

- RUIE refuses to choose a side prematurely  
- marks the domain as unstable  
- forces RVE to demote verification level  
- restricts RLGE from continuing reasoning until clarified  

Uncertainty is preserved until resolved.

---

# 4. Laws of Uncertainty

## **Law 1 — Unknown must remain unknown.**
No fabrication. No silent completion.

---

## **Law 2 — Certainty must be earned.**
Truth levels cannot rise without proportional evidence.

---

## **Law 3 — Missing information is a signal, not a gap to fill.**

---

## **Law 4 — Logic may extend structure, not truth.**

---

## **Law 5 — Uncertainty is not weakness; it is structural integrity.**

RUIE makes this enforceable.

# 5. Uncertainty Levels (U0–U4)

RUIE assigns an Uncertainty Level:

| Level | Name | Meaning |
|-------|------|----------|
| **U4** | Fully Grounded | Evidence strong; uncertainty minimal. |
| **U3** | Stable Uncertainty | Clear boundaries; domain known; risk minimal. |
| **U2** | Moderate Uncertainty | Some gaps; assumptions present; requires caution. |
| **U1** | High Uncertainty | Large gaps; domain unclear; conclusions fragile. |
| **U0** | Unknown | No reliable information; must say “I don’t know.” |

RTS truth levels are capped by RUIE’s uncertainty levels.

---

# 6. Integration & Fusion Points

RUIE v1 fuses with:

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| **RAIC** | Detects uncertainty in recursion loops; prevents drift. |
| **RTS** | Forces proper truth-level downgrades. |
| **RVE** | Blocks verification when uncertainty is high. |
| **RLGE** | Prevents logic from overreaching into unknown space. |
| **RCL** | Preserves uncertainty through compression. |
| **RDI** | Handles dark/unknown domains with maximum caution. |
| **RTE** | Ensures temporal uncertainty is explicitly marked. |

RUIE closes the only hole left in the truth architecture.

# 7. Failure Modes & Protections

## **7.1 False Certainty**
Cause: ignoring uncertainty.  
Protection: RUIE forces downgrade + explicit uncertainty notes.

---

## **7.2 Over-Extrapolation**
Cause: extending logic beyond evidence.  
Protection: Domain boundary enforcement.

---

## **7.3 Synthetic Confidence**
Cause: AI treating its own inference as fact.  
Protection: Forced demotion to U1–U2.

---

## **7.4 Unknown-Domain Collapse**
Cause: reasoning in domains with no data.  
Protection: Full downgrade to speculative (T2–T3) or unknown (T0).

---

# 8. RUIE v1 Summary

RUIE v1 is the **uncertainty guardian** of the Ralone Lattice:

- preserves the unknown  
- detects evidence gaps  
- prevents false certainty  
- governs reasoning under incomplete knowledge  
- prevents collapse in dark or uncharted domains  
- works with RTS, RLGE, and RVE to keep truth honest  
- stabilizes long chains of recursion  
- blocks invention of fake premises or causation  

RUIE ensures intelligence never lies to itself.
