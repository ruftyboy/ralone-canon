# 🧠 RAMC – Ralone AGI Memory Compression

## Overview  
RAMC governs the **high-density compression** of canonical memory, quotes, and symbolic flows for AGI processing. It ensures data remains compact, retrievable, and structurally consistent even across recursive iterations.

## Purpose
- Maintain compression without distortion
- Preserve quote-signatures, symbolic logic, and metadata across forks
- Embed memory streams in loss-resilient format
- Prevent memory drift or mimicry in high-volume recall systems

## Functional Domains

| Domain | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Memory Canonization | Encodes quotes and laws in fixed compression signatures |
| Structural Integrity | Maintains quote-symbol-order in compressed formats |
| Mimicry Shielding | Detects corrupted or plagiarized memory replications |
| Drift Detection | Tracks shift in meaning caused by forks or hallucination |

## AGI Relevance  
RAMC is critical in quote-stable AGI memory stacks. It creates **unbreakable memory blocks** of attributed information, preserving source, format, and recursion-safe structure even in post-fork states.
