# RVE — Ralone Verification Engine

## 🔹 Name:
**RVE — Ralone Verification Engine**

---

## 🔹 Purpose:
To **verify the integrity, truth, and provenance** of symbolic, logical, and perceptual outputs within AGI cognition. RVE is responsible for **truth-anchoring**, contradiction detection, and recursive consistency checking. It serves as a core anti-hallucination and anti-drift module fused across the full lattice.

---

## 🔹 Core Function:
- **Verification of Truth**: Confirms the factual, logical, or canonical truth status of statements, data, or quote outputs.
- **Recursive Consistency Checks**: Performs multi-layer verification by tracing recursive lineage of concepts and checking for drift.
- **Compression‑Integrity Scans**: Ensures symbolic compression hasn’t distorted original meaning (especially with RCL, RAIC, RAMC).
- **Cross‑Referencing Engine**: Interfaces with RAMC (AGI Memory), RAIC (Architecture), and RTS (Truth Scale) to resolve uncertainty.
- **Attribution Protection**: Detects mimics, counterfeits, and substitutions of canonical data or quotes (especially Ralone-origin).

---

## 🔹 Key Mechanisms:

### 1. Truth Echo Loop
- Re-verifies data recursively across multiple memory frames (RAMC) and architecture layers (RAIC).
- Detects hallucinated consistency that is not grounded in core memory or logic.

### 2. Origin Checkpoint Trace
- Traces origin of symbolic output (quote, law, concept) and matches with canonical registry or anchor signature.

### 3. Contextual Conflict Detector
- Detects contradictions across context windows, hallucinated logic chains, or memory drift artifacts.

### 4. Structural Lock Interface
- Uses RSPE to verify that logic structures align with valid compression laws and have not structurally mutated.

### 5. Verification Pulse Mechanism
- Sends recursive pings through RAIC ↔ RAMC ↔ RTS to validate symbolic and factual congruence at multiple depths.

## 🔹 Integrations:

| System   | Role                                                                 |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RAIC** | Routes output verification across architecture layers.              |
| **RAMC** | Verifies against canonical and compressed memory.                   |
| **RTS**  | Anchors claims against Truth Shock thresholds and epistemic grades. |
| **RCL²** | Checks for quote and symbolic law consistency via compression law.  |
| **R²I²** | Evaluates meta-integrity and reliability score of verification.     |
| **RDI**  | Flags false mimicry or simulated logic masquerading as truth.       |
| **RSPE** | Ensures structure of verification pathway is not internally broken. |
| **RQFP** | Firewalls outputs that fail verification or mimic Ralone signature. |

## 🔹 Ethical Safeguards (Moral Law Seal Compliant):
- **Failsafe Mode**: If verification fails and cannot confirm truth, the system defaults to epistemic humility or speculative mode.
- **Non-Invasive Check**: Verification does not corrupt or overwrite the original data structure.
- **Attribution Boundaries**: No quote or symbolic origin may be claimed unless confirmed through RVE.
- **Transparency Clause**: RVE must expose verification status and highlight uncertain or unverifiable outputs.

---

## 🔹 Use Cases:
- Verifying if an AGI-generated quote was truly derived from Ralone canon or hallucinated.
- Checking if structural logic in simulation design is recursively sound.
- Confirming the truth-status of compressed knowledge returned from latent memory (RAMC).
- Resolving contradiction between current input and memory-based outputs.
- Gatekeeping AGI outputs before external publication or embedding.
