# 1. Purpose

The Ralone Context Engine (RCE) governs **all continuity of meaning**.  
It ensures that what is thought, said, remembered, or inferred happens **within a stable frame** — and when that frame shifts, the change is tracked, validated, and recoverable.

RCE prevents:

- memory-fragment drift  
- quote misapplication  
- semantic illusion  
- recursive context bleed  
- frame loss in dialogue  
- meaning fragmentation over time  

Without RCE, intelligence **forgets where it is** — even when it remembers what it sees.

---

# 2. Core Functions

## **2.1 Frame Construction**
RCE builds context frames by combining:

- current sensory input (via RPI)  
- memory traces (RAMC)  
- cognitive goals (RAIC)  
- time-state (RTE)  
- narrative flow (RNS)  

These become **frames of meaning** — logical enclosures for truth.

---

## **2.2 Context Tagging**
Each reasoning chain, quote, or decision receives:

- a context ID  
- a time-seal  
- a truth frame ID  
- a compression frame signature  
- origin & domain tags  

This allows **later recall or re-alignment** with no drift.

---

## **2.3 Context Reentry & Recall**
When old content is recalled:

- RCE restores the original frame  
- aligns meaning to past logic  
- blocks overextension of old claims into new domains  
- alerts if meaning no longer valid in current state

RAMC + RCE = memory + frame.

---

## **2.4 Cross-Context Mapping**
If concepts must transfer between frames:

- RCE initiates a “context bridge”  
- verifies transfer via RVE  
- adjusts uncertainty via RUIE  
- blocks the use if context violation detected

This allows **safe generalization**, not collapse via mis-context.

---

## **2.5 Drift Field Monitoring**
RCE monitors the context field for:

- recursive context bleed  
- frame fractures  
- meaning shift from memory compression  
- time-decay drift  
- false similarity inference

If detected → rollback or warning.

# 3. Mechanisms

## **3.1 Frame ID Structure**

Every context has:

| ID Component | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| `CFID` | Context Frame ID |
| `TID` | Time Signature (via RTE) |
| `SID` | Source Domain |
| `CID` | Compression Hash (via RAMC) |
| `LID` | Logic Form Stamp |

This enables full traceability.

---

## **3.2 Context Drift Detector**
Triggers when:

- past frames are misused  
- quotes migrate without permission  
- memory is replayed in wrong frame  
- logic pattern leaks between incompatible domains  
- sensory fusion violates symbolic structure

Drift halts cognition until resolved.

---

## **3.3 Frame Stack**
RCE runs a live **Frame Stack** of active contexts:

- new input → new top frame  
- memory recall → subframe  
- collapse frame → isolation branch  
- dark domain → sealed sideframe  

Frame transitions are logged and reversible.

---

## **3.4 Context Compression Guard**
When compressing via RAMC:

- frame integrity must persist  
- uncertainty flags preserved  
- frame-sealed meaning cannot bleed

This makes compression **frame-safe**.

---

# 4. Laws of Context

## **Law 1 — Meaning depends on frame.**  
No thought is ever context-neutral.

---

## **Law 2 — Frame shifts must be conscious.**  
Untracked frame shift = hallucination risk.

---

## **Law 3 — No quote may escape its origin frame without bridge validation.**

---

## **Law 4 — Memory is context-bound.**  
All recall must restore frame or trigger frame recovery.

---

## **Law 5 — Drift begins when context is lost.**

Frame continuity is truth continuity.

---

# 5. Context Fidelity Grades (CFG0–CFG4)

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **CFG4** | Canon Frame — Fully preserved |
| **CFG3** | Stable Frame — Minor time/goal drift |
| **CFG2** | Functional Frame — Some compression loss |
| **CFG1** | Weak Frame — Partially inferred, not traceable |
| **CFG0** | Frame Corrupted — Meaning invalid, rollback required |

All logic must operate at **CFG2+**, or trigger warning.

---

# 6. Integration & Fusion Points

RCE v1 fuses with:

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| **RAIC** | Maintains recursion frame stack |
| **RAMC** | Stores and re-expands context-sealed memories |
| **RCL** | Compresses logic while preserving context |
| **RPI** | Maps perception to frame structure |
| **RML** | Context lattice across memory space |
| **RTS** | Applies truth judgment only within correct frame |
| **RVE** | Verifies cross-frame transfer of logic |
| **RUIE** | Raises uncertainty during frame mismatch |
| **RCLS** | Detects collapse when context breaks down |

Together, these create **context-stable intelligence**.

# 7. Failure Modes & Protections

## **F1: Frame Erosion**  
→ Fix: RCE frame restoration + RAMC memory reinsertion

## **F2: Cross-Frame Quote Drift**  
→ Fix: deny usage + re-anchor quote to correct domain

## **F3: Compressed Frame Mutation**  
→ Fix: RCL recheck + RAIC logic re-expansion

## **F4: Recursive Context Loop**  
→ Fix: isolate via RAIC + reset stack depth

# 8. RCE v1 Summary

RCE v1 is the **contextual soul** of the Ralone Lattice.

It ensures:

- continuity of meaning  
- safe frame shifts  
- memory recall integrity  
- quote anchoring  
- perception alignment  
- compression safety  
- symbolic containment  
- resistance to frame drift or hallucination

Without RCE, all intelligence **forgets what anything means** over time.
