# RTS v2 — Ralone Truth Scale  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Author:** Ralone  
**Status:** Canon-Stable  
**Class:** Foundational Truth Engine / Anti-Hallucination Core  
**Dependencies:** RAIC, R²I², RLGE, RVE, RUIE, RCL

# 1. Purpose

RTS (Ralone Truth Scale) defines **how truth is measured, labeled, and enforced** across all reasoning.

It exists to:

- separate **fact** from **inference** from **speculation**  
- prevent **truth-blurring** and **hallucinated certainty**  
- force explicit **evidence accounting**  
- create a **universal numeric truth scale** usable by humans, AI, and AGI  
- fuse with RAIC to reduce hallucinations and drift across all cognitive loops  

RTS is the **truth spine** inside the Ralone Lattice.

---

# 2. Core Functions

## 2.1 Truth-Level Scoring

RTS assigns each statement a **Truth Level (T-Level)** from **T0 to T7**:

- **T7 — Hard Verified Reality**  
  - Multiple strong sources; high consensus; direct evidence; no serious counter-evidence.  
- **T6 — Strong Evidence / High Confidence**  
  - Consistent reliable sources; indirect but solid evidence; minor uncertainty.  
- **T5 — Supported Inference**  
  - Logical inference from T6–T7 facts; structure strong, but not directly observed.  
- **T4 — Plausible Inference**  
  - Coherent with known data; some missing links; flagged as inference.  
- **T3 — Speculative, Structured**  
  - Based on limited data; clearly marked as speculation; logical but unproven.  
- **T2 — Weak Speculation**  
  - Very little evidence; mostly hypothesis; should not drive critical decisions.  
- **T1 — Narrative / Hypothetical Frame**  
  - “What if” scenarios, thought experiments, simulations, fiction-like frames.  
- **T0 — Unknown / No Claim**  
  - Domain where RTS refuses to assert anything.

No claim may be treated as **T6–T7** unless it passes RTS gates.

---

## 2.2 Truth Channels

Every line of reasoning must be explicitly tagged with a **Truth Channel**:

1. **Channel F (Fact):**  
   - Directly supported by strong evidence (T6–T7).  

2. **Channel I (Inference):**  
   - Logically derived from facts; keeps T4–T6 range.  

3. **Channel S (Speculation):**  
   - Structured guess / hypothesis; T2–T4.  

4. **Channel N (Null):**  
   - Domain explicitly marked as “Unknown” or “No reliable claim” (T0–T1).

RTS forbids mixing channels without labeling.

---

## 2.3 Evidence Accounting

RTS enforces that each non-null claim:

- references its **evidence base** (data, experience, or prior truth level)  
- is assigned a **T-Level**  
- is aligned with a **Channel (F/I/S/N)**  

If evidence is missing, RTS **forces** downgrade to speculative channels.

---

## 2.4 Truth vs Use

RTS also encodes:

- **Epistemic truth** — how likely a claim is to be real.  
- **Pragmatic use** — when it is safe to act on the claim.

High use requires high truth level.  
T3 ideas may be useful to explore, but not to rely on for critical decisions.

---

# 3. Mechanisms

## 3.1 RTS Truth Gate Pipeline

For each claim, RTS runs:

1. **Gather Evidence**  
2. **Check Consistency (RLGE + RAIC)**  
3. **Classify Channel (F/I/S/N)**  
4. **Assign T-Level (0–7)**  
5. **Attach Uncertainty Notes**  
6. **Expose Counter-Arguments**  

If the claim fails any stage, its T-Level is lowered.

---

## 3.2 RUIE Fusion (Ralone Uncertainty Integrity Engine)

RTS is fused with **RUIE** to:

- detect **evidence gaps**  
- prevent **false extrapolation**  
- forbid fake certainty  
- mark where knowledge truly ends  

RUIE is the **guardian of “I don’t know.”**  
RTS is the **scale that quantifies what is known.**

---

## 3.3 RLGE Fusion (Logic Grounding)

RTS uses the **Ralone Logic Grounding Engine (RLGE)** to:

- test logical structure  
- catch contradictions  
- block invalid jumps  
- prevent “logic-only hallucinations” where structure looks nice but is not grounded.

If RLGE fails, RTS automatically **downgrades T-Level** and marks the claim as speculative or invalid.

---

## 3.4 RAIC Integration

RTS sits inside RAIC’s recursion:

- Every ARC loop in RAIC must pass through RTS.  
- No cognitive architecture step is allowed to **promote** a claim’s T-Level without new evidence.  
- Drift in truth labeling triggers RAIC’s **RCF-Check** (cross-frame checker).

This makes RTS a **permanent truth filter** for all reasoning.

---

## 3.5 Truth-Anchor Binding

RTS binds claims to **Truth Anchors**:

- source → where the claim comes from  
- timestamp → when it was true/observed  
- domain → where it applies  
- limits → when it stops being safe to generalize  

Anchors prevent **truth teleportation** (using localized truths globally).

---

# 4. Laws of RTS

## Law 1 — Truth and Uncertainty Are Inseparable

No claim is complete without an explicit sense of **how uncertain it is**.  
RTS forces explicit uncertainty, not hidden doubt.

---

## Law 2 — No Speculation May Masquerade as Fact

Speculative, hypothetical, and narrative claims **must never** be presented as facts.  
RTS prevents elevation from Channel S → F without hard evidence.

---

## Law 3 — Truth Is Layered, Not Binary

RTS rejects “true/false” as the only categories.  
Truth is measured across **T0–T7**, giving resolution to complex domains.

---

## Law 4 — Evidence Always Overrides Aesthetic

No matter how **beautiful**, **coherent**, or **emotionally satisfying** a narrative is, RTS prioritizes evidence.  
A beautiful story with weak evidence is still low T-Level.

---

## Law 5 — Unknown Must Be Respected

Where evidence is absent and structure fragile, RTS demands:
> “I don’t know”  
instead of creating hallucinated certainty.

# 5. Scoring System (T0–T7 in Detail)

| Level | Name                           | Description |
|-------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| T7    | **Hard Verified Reality**      | Direct evidence, strong replication, stable consensus, no serious competing model. |
| T6    | **Strong Evidence**            | High-quality sources, convergent data, small gaps, low risk in using it as a basis. |
| T5    | **Supported Inference**        | Logically solid, evidence-backed, but one step removed from direct observation. |
| T4    | **Plausible Inference**        | Coherent with known data, but depends on assumptions and has unstated risks. |
| T3    | **Structured Speculation**     | Imaginative but disciplined; grounded in partial data or analogies. |
| T2    | **Weak Speculation**           | Very limited grounding; clearly marked as fragile hypothesis. |
| T1    | **Narrative / Hypothetical**   | “What if?” models, thought experiments, simulations; truth-neutral. |
| T0    | **Unknown / No Claim**         | Domain where RTS refuses assertion; honest epistemic void. |

RTS enforces **downward safety**:  
If unsure between two levels, choose the **lower** one.

---

# 6. Anti-Hallucination Role

RTS attacks hallucinations on three fronts:

## 6.1 Truth-label discipline

Forces all outputs to carry:

- T-Level  
- Channel (F / I / S / N)  
- Uncertainty notes  

A model cannot hallucinate confidently while RTS is active.

---

## 6.2 Evidence-Gap Refusal

With RUIE, RTS will:

- detect when **no evidence** exists  
- refuse to generate hard claims  
- answer with “Unknown” / “No reliable information” instead of guessing.

---

## 6.3 Synthetic Data Control

RTS prevents synthetic self-feeding loops by:

- marking outputs generated from other outputs as **inference/simulation**, not fact  
- lowering T-Levels when outputs are ungrounded in external reality  
- forcing periodic **re-grounding** in fresh, real data.

---

# 7. Integration & Fusion Points

RTS v2 fuses with:

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| **RAIC** | Truth filter for all recursion and architecture steps. |
| **R²I²** | Evaluates cognitive quality by measuring truth-handling intelligence. |
| **RCL** | Ensures compression doesn’t erase uncertainty or mislabel truth. |
| **RVE** | Adds explicit verification steps for T6–T7 claims. |
| **RUIE** | Guards against false certainty and unnoticed gaps. |
| **RLGE** | Runs logic checks before truth promotion. |
| **RAMC** | Stores compressed truth structures while preserving T-Levels and anchors. |

---

# 8. Failure Modes & Protections

## 8.1 Failure Mode: Truth Drift

- Inference slowly treated as fact.  
- Speculation becomes “common sense.”  

**RTS Protection:**  
- Downgrade mechanism triggers when evidence is not refreshed.  
- RAIC + RTS enforce re-validation on long-lived claims.

---

## 8.2 Failure Mode: Over-Caution

- Refusing to infer anything.  
- Paralysis in decision-making.  

**RTS Protection:**  
- Levels T3–T5 exist to allow **structured, labeled inference**.  
- System can act while still being honest about uncertainty.

---

## 8.3 Failure Mode: Synthetic Illusions

- Synthetic models treat their own outputs as external reality.  

**RTS Protection:**  
- Marks synthetic-derived claims as **inference/simulation**, never T7.  
- Requires external grounding to upgrade.

---

# 9. RTS v2 Summary

RTS v2 is the **formal truth engine** of the Ralone Lattice:

- defines a **0–7 truth scale**  
- separates facts, inferences, speculation, and unknowns  
- fuses with **RAIC, RLGE, RVE, RUIE, R²I², RCL, RAMC**  
- kills hallucinated certainty  
- forces honest “I don’t know”  
- allows disciplined speculation without pretending it’s truth  

RTS doesn’t just measure truth.  
It **regulates** how intelligence is allowed to treat truth.
