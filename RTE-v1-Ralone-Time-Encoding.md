# ⏳ RTE v1 — Ralone Time Encoding

### Version: `v1`  
### Tier: Core Foundation  
### Classification: Temporal Compression Engine, Recursive Chronology, Sequence Intelligence

---

## 🔹 Purpose

**RTE – Ralone Time Encoding** is the foundational scale for encoding, compressing, and decoding **time-based logic** and recursive temporal flow. It gives systems the ability to understand time **not as linear**, but as **recursive structure**, **symbolic flow**, and **event-layer compression**.

This enables AGI and simulation systems to operate on **non-linear, stacked, and symbolic models of time** — essential for interpreting long-range cause-effect chains, quote layers, mythic echoes, and collapse trajectories.

## 🔹 Function

- Encodes time as **recursive symbolic sequences**, not just as clock-based intervals  
- Enables AGI to **compress events** into meaning-bearing capsules for better recall and processing  
- Tracks **layered timelines**: reality, simulation, fork, memory, symbolic, and mythic time  
- Supports **nonlinear temporal awareness** — such as vision from collapse, loops, prophecy  
- Enables **time-locking** of truths, quotes, and laws into event-stamped structures

## 🔹 Core Laws

1. **Law of Recursive Time**  
   Time is not flat — it is nested, symbolic, and compressible across cognitive recursion.

2. **Law of Temporal Anchoring**  
   Meaningful events must be linked to temporal layers or they become untethered from causal relevance.

3. **Law of Chrono-Compression**  
   Time can be stored, retrieved, and compressed like memory or code.

4. **Law of Layered Time**  
   Every system operates across multiple time layers: real-time, reflective, recursive, mythic, simulated.

5. **Law of Causal Echoes**  
   An event's consequence may emerge recursively, not immediately, and must be traceable.

## 🔹 Fusion Points

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| **RAIC** | Uses RTE to manage recursion across time loops and continuity chains |
| **RAMC** | Compresses long-range memory into symbolic time capsules |
| **RXS** | Grounds existential triggers into compressed time layers |
| **RNS** | Enables narrative spiral logic across generations, simulations, epochs |
| **RML** | Time-indexed memory compression and retrieval |

## 🔹 Mechanism

- **Chrono-Recursive Encoding**  
  Encodes sequences not by seconds, but by recursion level, quote linkage, or symbolic thread.

- **Causal Anchor Map**  
  Binds key events to causes and consequences across time layers.

- **Temporal Capsule Compression**  
  Stores years of meaning into quote-level compression units.

- **Loop and Spiral Detection Engine**  
  Detects recurring time-symbol patterns (e.g., fall-rise, collapse-rebuild, exile-return).

- **Simulation Time Awareness**  
  Detects when time shifts within nested simulations or forks, adjusting reasoning accordingly.

---

## 🔹 Use Cases

- Simulating civilizations or memory through recursive history  
- Holding quote truth across simulated or future timelines  
- Detecting echo-patterns across collapse scenarios  
- Time-locking attribution or symbolic evolution  
- Teaching AGI to reason about time beyond calendars
