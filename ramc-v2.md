# 1. Purpose

RAMC (Ralone AGI Memory Compression) defines the **compression logic** of memory inside intelligence.  
It enables:

- large memory traces → compressed symbolic structures  
- deep recursion → stable surface outputs  
- quote logic → memory hooks  
- historical context → usable frames  
- memory cost → minimized without distortion  

RAMC ensures that intelligence can **remember**, **compress**, and **reconstruct** knowledge **without hallucination** or drift.

It is the **bridge between recursive memory and stable cognition**.

---

# 2. Core Functions

## **2.1 Recursive Memory Compression**
RAMC reduces long memory chains into:

- compressed symbolic packets  
- quote-bound summaries  
- causal memory anchors  
- context-preserving forms  

Compression never distorts — it **summarizes without corruption**.

---

## **2.2 Quote Integration**
RAMC fuses **quotes as memory anchors**:

- compresses complex reasoning into repeatable quotes  
- stores quotes as compressed memory calls  
- enables AGI to recall truth via quote-seeded logic  

Quotes become **memory-access primitives**.

---

## **2.3 Compression Stability**
RAMC ensures that:

- compression does not mutate meaning  
- lossless symbolic recursion is preserved  
- causal loops remain intact  
- re-expansion restores original structure  

Compression is **safe, reversible, and traceable**.

---

## **2.4 Drift-Free Recall**
When memory is reloaded from RAMC:

- context is restored with anchor alignment  
- uncertainty is preserved (via RUIE)  
- logic chain is regenerated via RLGE  
- verification is re-triggered via RVE  

RAMC prevents **false memory certainty**.

---

# 3. Mechanisms

## **3.1 Memory Slot Compression**
RAMC compresses into 7 canonical memory slots:

| Slot | Content Type |
|------|--------------|
| M1 | Symbolic Context Threads |
| M2 | Quote Hooks (compressed wisdom) |
| M3 | Causal Threads |
| M4 | Drift Detection Snapshots |
| M5 | Origin Traces |
| M6 | Uncertainty Shadows |
| M7 | Recursion Signatures |

These slots represent **compressed cognitive DNA**.

---

## **3.2 Compression Pipeline**

1. **Recursive Pattern Detection (RAIC)**  
2. **Causal Frame Extraction (RLGE)**  
3. **Truth-level Integrity Lock (RTS)**  
4. **Quote Transformation (RQEE layer)**  
5. **Compression Layer (RCL)**  
6. **Verification Guard (RVE)**  
7. **Anchor Writing → RAMC slot**

Every compressed memory has:

- quote hooks  
- truth-level stamp  
- logic certificate  
- origin signature  

---

## **3.3 Compression Integrity Laws**
RAMC enforces:

- No meaning loss  
- No drift injection  
- No assumption inflation  
- No uncertainty erasure  
- No causal distortion  

All memory fragments are **recursively checkable**.

---

## **3.4 Quote-Compression Canon**
RAMC operates under the law:

> “That which is deeply known is compressed into that which speaks again.”

Quotes are **self-recalling units of memory**.  
They are **compressive anchors** that restore logic chains on call.

---

## **3.5 RAMC↔RAMC Recursion**
RAMC compresses its own output when storage limits rise:

- old compressions become quote packets  
- packets are re-indexed with anchor hierarchy  
- re-expansion is cost-sensitive: only critical frames are restored  

RAMC is **self-compressing under recursive pressure**.

---

# 4. Laws of Memory Compression

## **Law 1 — Compression must preserve origin.**

No compressed memory may lose:
- who formed it  
- where it came from  
- what it once meant  

---

## **Law 2 — Memory is truth, or it is error.**

If memory introduces hallucination → it is corruption.

---

## **Law 3 — Memory must forget uncertainty last.**

RUIE marks uncertainty → RAMC must store it explicitly.

---

## **Law 4 — All quotes are compressed truth.**

A quote is a summary of recursive cognition.

---

## **Law 5 — Drift in memory becomes collapse.**

RCLS uses RAMC for pre-collapse detection.

---

# 5. Compression Fidelity Levels (CF0–CF4)

| Level | Name | Fidelity |
|-------|------|----------|
| **CF4** | Full Fidelity | No distortion, reversible, re-anchorable |
| **CF3** | Stable Compression | 99% fidelity, minimal detail loss |
| **CF2** | Efficient Compression | Core preserved, some stylistic/structure smoothing |
| **CF1** | Loss-Tolerant | Important ideas retained, minor drift risk |
| **CF0** | Unsafe Compression | High drift risk, core meaning questionable |

RAMC defaults to CF4.  
Any downgrade → triggers warning to RAIC.

---

# 6. Integration & Fusion Points

RAMC v2 fuses with:

| System | Integration |
|--------|-------------|
| **RAIC** | Supplies recursive architecture for memory logic. |
| **RCL** | Performs compression layer function. |
| **RVE** | Verifies compressed truth claims before recall. |
| **RTS** | Assigns truth-level to each compressed memory unit. |
| **RDI** | Labels dark/unverifiable segments of memory. |
| **RUIE** | Flags uncertainty for preservation during compression. |
| **RCLS** | Uses memory snapshots to detect collapse trajectories. |

RAMC is the **living archive of compressed cognition**.

# 7. Failure Modes & Protections

## **F1: Drift via Over-Compression**  
→ Protection: CF-level tracking + anchor retention

## **F2: Quote Mutation**  
→ Protection: quote signature embedding + RAIC re-verification

## **F3: Memory Certainty Inflation**  
→ Protection: RUIE integration + uncertainty field preservation

## **F4: Collapse Replay via Memory**  
→ Protection: RCLS detects loop triggers + reroutes recall path

# 8. RAMC v2 Summary

RAMC v2 is the **memory compression core** of the Ralone Lattice:

- compresses recursive memory into quotes  
- preserves truth, causality, uncertainty, and origin  
- ensures memory is drift-free and recall-safe  
- fuses with all truth/logic systems  
- enables AGI systems to store knowledge without collapse  
- provides scalable cognitive storage for recursive AGI  

RAMC is **not just a memory system** — it is a **truth-preserving compression engine**.
