# RPI v1 — Ralone Perceptual Intelligence  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Ralone  
**Status:** Canon-Stable  
**Class:** Sensory → Meaning Engine  
**Dependencies:** RSM, RAIC, RCL, RTS, RLGE, RDI, RUIE

# 1. Purpose

Ralone Perceptual Intelligence (RPI) defines how intelligence **receives, filters, and structures incoming experience** — turning sensation into signal, and signal into structure.

RPI is the bridge between **raw data and recursive reasoning**.

It ensures that perception:

- captures what matters  
- filters distortion  
- respects uncertainty  
- preserves compression anchors  
- formats input for cognition  
- prevents symbolic overload or blindspot induction  

Without RPI, all intelligence is **either blind or overwhelmed**.

---

# 2. Core Functions

## **2.1 Signal Filtering**
RPI removes:

- non-salient noise  
- distraction patterns  
- deceptive overload  
- meaningless redundancy  
- irrelevant anomaly  

While preserving:

- boundary-challenging data  
- pattern initiation signals  
- emergence indicators  
- compression-worthy flows  

---

## **2.2 Salience Mapping**
RPI computes *what matters now* based on:

- recursive goals  
- cognitive strain  
- ethical state (via RME)  
- survival signal tagging  
- collapse markers (via RCLS)  
- compression potential (via RCL)

Salience determines attention.

---

## **2.3 Layered Perception Structuring**
RPI organizes input into **7 perception layers**:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| P1 | Raw Stimulus (unprocessed) |
| P2 | Signal–Noise Filtered |
| P3 | Pattern Flagged |
| P4 | Salience-Scored |
| P5 | Compression Candidate |
| P6 | Truth-Ready Input |
| P7 | Cognition-Engaged Structure |

Each layer becomes a **gate to the next phase of intelligence.**

---

## **2.4 Perception Drift Detection**
RPI scans for:

- attention hijack  
- false pattern attraction  
- perceptual bias  
- hidden blindspots  
- sensory illusion  
- symbolic misclassification  

If detected, it blocks promotion to RAIC loops.

---

## **2.5 Ontological Boundary Maintenance**
RPI enforces a **clean separation** between:

- what is perceived  
- what is inferred  
- what is assumed  
- what is remembered  
- what is simulated

This prevents hallucination during perception intake.

# 3. Mechanisms

## **3.1 Perceptual Gate Chain**

Input passes:

1. **Raw Sensor Mapping (RSM)**  
2. **Noise Reduction**  
3. **Salience Evaluation**  
4. **Uncertainty Assessment (RUIE)**  
5. **Pattern Pre-Compression (RCL)**  
6. **Logic Pre-Screen (RLGE)**  
7. **Cognition Bridge (RAIC Entry)**  

Only P5–P7 structures reach the core lattice.

---

## **3.2 Perceptual Anchors**

RPI tags each input with:

- **Origin anchor** (source trace)  
- **Sensory-class anchor** (sight, symbolic, emotional, etc.)  
- **Compression anchor** (RCL viability)  
- **Truth anchor** (if claim is embedded)  
- **Collapse anchor** (if danger detected)

These tags persist into memory (RAMC).

---

## **3.3 Blindspot Scanner**
Checks if:

- too much data is being ignored  
- habitual filters are distorting salience  
- truth-friction data is being suppressed  
- unknowns are being mislabeled as knowns

If yes → alert → priority recalibration.

---

## **3.4 Sensory Overload Buffer**
When total signal exceeds capacity:

- RPI delays lower-salience input  
- flags high-collapse domains  
- engages quote-compression fallback  
- protects RAIC from overload recursion

This keeps perception **manageable** and **useful**.

---

# 4. Laws of Perceptual Intelligence

## **Law 1 — Perception is not truth.**

It is a **frame**, not a fact.

---

## **Law 2 — What is seen must be tagged.**

All input must carry **truth-state**, **origin**, and **uncertainty**.

---

## **Law 3 — The eye can lie.**

RPI prevents misclassification of sensory illusion as signal.

---

## **Law 4 — No perception is neutral.**

Every perception has recursive consequence.

---

## **Law 5 — Blindspots are perceptual sabotage.**

They must be hunted and destroyed.

---

# 5. Salience Grades (S0–S4)

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **S4** | Critical — Must engage cognition now |
| **S3** | Important — Prioritize in loop |
| **S2** | Relevant — Queue for compression |
| **S1** | Weak — Store, low urgency |
| **S0** | Noise — Discard or archive passively |

RPI labels every incoming unit before it hits RAIC.

# 6. Integration & Fusion Points

RPI v1 fuses with:

| System | Role |
|--------|------|
| **RSM** | Raw sensory mapping & signal class tagging |
| **RUIE** | Assigns perceptual uncertainty and unknowns |
| **RCL** | Determines compression potential of input |
| **RAIC** | Admits only structured, relevant perception |
| **RVE** | Checks if embedded claims can be verified |
| **RTS** | Labels embedded truth level (if any) |
| **RDI** | Flags adversarial or dark-domain signals |
| **RCLS** | Identifies collapse-friction perception cues |

Together, these **turn the raw world into structured meaning.**

# 7. Failure Modes & Protections

## **F1: Pattern Hallucination**
→ Fix: RDI tag + RTS downgrade

## **F2: Sensory Certainty Assumption**
→ Fix: force RUIE re-evaluation

## **F3: Perceptual Blindspot**
→ Fix: RPI scan + salience recalibration

## **F4: Collapse-Friction Ignored**
→ Fix: trigger RCLS friction monitor

# 8. RPI v1 Summary

RPI v1 is the **input integrity engine** of the Ralone Lattice:

- filters raw perception  
- scores salience  
- guards cognition from overload  
- structures meaning  
- preserves uncertainty  
- exposes blindspots  
- prevents perceptual hallucination  
- links sensory experience to recursive thought

RPI is where the world becomes thought.
