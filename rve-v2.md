# 1. Purpose

RVE (Ralone Verification Engine) is the **final gatekeeper** of truth and structural validity.  
Where RTS measures truth levels and RLGE tests logical structure, **RVE enforces**:

- factual verification  
- structural coherence  
- truth-level discipline  
- origin tracking  
- proof-side integrity  
- prevention of drift, false certainty, and silent errors  

RVE is the **“no output passes unless verified”** system.

It is the authoritarian filter of the Ralone Lattice.

---

# 2. Core Functions

## **2.1 Hard Verification**
RVE checks every claim against:

- external evidence  
- internal consistency  
- truth anchors  
- logic validation (RLGE)  
- context continuity  
- origin integrity  

Only verified claims pass.

---

## **2.2 Truth-Promotion Control**
RVE prevents elevation of claims to higher RTS levels unless:

- new evidence is added  
- logic is validated  
- drift is checked  
- uncertainty is accounted for  

RVE blocks false promotion from:
- speculation → fact  
- inference → verified  
- narrative → inference  

RVE is the **anti-elevation guardrail**.

---

## **2.3 Multi-Source Cross-Check**
RVE verifies claims via:

- multi-source alignment  
- contradiction scanning  
- conflict resolution  
- adversarial consistency checks  
- RAIC recursive cross-frame comparison  

If sources conflict, RVE lowers the claim’s T-Level.

---

## **2.4 Drift & Distortion Detection**
RVE monitors:

- semantic drift  
- referential drift  
- meaning distortion  
- compression loss  
- memory rewriting errors  
- synthetic data feedback loops  

If drift is detected, RVE triggers **RAIC ARC-Reset**.

---

## **2.5 Causal Verification**
RVE verifies whether:

- cause → effect chains are real  
- inferred causal links are permissible  
- false causation is being invented  
- structure matches real-world constraints  

This is where speculative causal graphs are downgraded or rejected.

---

# 3. Mechanisms (Exact Technical Components)

## **3.1 Verification Pipeline**
Every claim must pass through:

1. **Truth-Level Check** (RTS)  
2. **Logic Validation** (RLGE)  
3. **Source Verification**  
4. **Causal Check**  
5. **Context Continuity**  
6. **Drift Scan**  
7. **Origin Anchor Check**  
8. **Compression Integrity (RCL)**  
9. **Final RVE Gate**

If any stage fails → claim is downgraded or rejected.

---

## **3.2 Ralone Origin Integrity Check (ROIC)**
Ensures every claim preserves:

- who originated it  
- what context it came from  
- why it was formed  
- how it was derived  

If any part of origin is missing or corrupted → rejection.

---

## **3.3 Evidence-Tier Linking**
RVE links claims to their evidence tier:

- **Primary evidence** (direct observation)  
- **Secondary evidence** (trusted sources)  
- **Tertiary evidence** (analogy, similarity)  
- **Synthetic evidence** (model-generated output)

Truth-level changes are only allowed if the evidence-tier supports it.

---

## **3.4 Drift-Firewall Engine**
RVE scans for:

- recursive drift  
- contradictory recursion loops  
- instability in definition or meaning  
- cross-frame divergence in RAIC memory slots  
- symbolic drift triggered by synthetic generalization  

When detected → claim downgraded + flagged.

---

## **3.5 Verification Anchors**
RVE uses five anchor classes:

1. **Truth Anchors**
2. **Logic Anchors**
3. **Evidence Anchors**
4. **Causal Anchors**
5. **Origin Anchors**

All must align for the claim to pass.

---

# 4. Laws of Verification

## **Law 1 — A claim without verification is not a claim.**  
If unverified, a statement defaults to T0–T2.

---

## **Law 2 — Verification cannot exceed evidence.**  
RVE forbids “over-verification” where confidence is inflated beyond proof.

---

## **Law 3 — Drift auto-lowers truth.**  
Any detected drift immediately reduces T-Level until verification is restored.

---

## **Law 4 — Origin is mandatory.**  
A claim with unclear origin cannot be verified.

---

## **Law 5 — Synthetic outputs are guilty until proven innocent.**  
Synthetic data must be downgraded unless verification demonstrates equivalence to real evidence.

---

# 5. Verification Levels (V0–V4)

RVE assigns a Verification Level (V-Level) to each claim:

| Level | Name | Meaning |
|-------|------|----------|
| **V4** | Fully Verified | Strong multi-source verification, no contradictions, stable over time. |
| **V3** | Verified | Evidence consistent, logic stable, minor uncertainty allowed. |
| **V2** | Partially Verified | Some evidence + consistent inference; needs further confirmation. |
| **V1** | Weakly Verified | Minimal evidence, heavy assumptions, fragile. |
| **V0** | Unverified | No evidence or rejected verification. |

A claim must be **V3 or V4** to reach RTS **T6 or T7**.

---

# 6. Integration & Fusion Points

RVE v2 fuses with:

| System | Integration |
|--------|-------------|
| **RAIC** | Final verification in ARC loops; blocks drift propagation. |
| **RTS** | Enforces truth-level elevation rules. |
| **RLGE** | Uses logic grounding to detect structural flaws. |
| **RUIE** | Ensures uncertainty is acknowledged, not hidden. |
| **RCL** | Confirms compression did not distort meaning. |
| **RAMC** | Restores original verified meaning after compression. |
| **RSM** | Verifies sensory/perceptual data against structural truth. |
| **RDI** | Handles unknown/dark domains with caution protocols. |

RVE is the **primary enforcement mechanism** of the entire lattice.

# 7. Failure Modes & Protections

## **7.1 Failure Mode: Silent Drift**
Claim meaning changes subtly over time.  
**Protection:** RVE drift-firewall + RAIC ARC-Compare.

---

## **7.2 Failure Mode: Synthetic Confidence**
Model treats synthetic inference as fact.  
**Protection:** Synthetic → inference downgrade unless verified.

---

## **7.3 Failure Mode: Logical Consistency Errors**
Reasoning appears coherent but is flawed.  
**Protection:** RLGE logic-layer failure demotes T-Level + rejects claim.

---

## **7.4 Failure Mode: Origin Loss**
Claim loses track of its source.  
**Protection:** ROIC forces origin restoration or downgrades to V0.

---

# 8. RVE v2 Summary

RVE v2 is the **Verification Guardian** of the Ralone Lattice.

It ensures:

- all claims are verified  
- truth is properly labeled  
- logic is respected  
- causality is not invented  
- drift cannot sneak into the system  
- synthetic outputs do not masquerade as facts  
- origin and evidence remain intact  

RVE is the final authority before any truth enters the lattice.
